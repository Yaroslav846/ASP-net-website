Name: Auch Font
Designer: Murat Yüksel (((automatte)) 2019

As a graphic designer, the idea of designing a font has been on my mind for quite some time.Though I never researched how to do so. Recently, while browsing in YouTube, I saw a video about how to design a font and decided to design an all-caps font to use in one of my projects. With the addition of lowercase letters, symbols etc. emerged a font with small inherent glitches, a mono quality despite not being aligned like a mono font, and small mistakes in the kerning. At a certain point I quit designing the font because I hadn't wholly figured out how to use my font designing program.

If you like it, it's free to use in personal or corporate work.
